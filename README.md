# Codemash_Racing_Arduino

This is the Arduino software for the (Geeny Racing App)[https://github.com/StefanHermannBerlin/Geeny_Racing_App] we created for the Codemash 2018. 

It is a sensor and motor controll unit for a slot car racing (Carrera tracks). 

## Hardware

- Arduino UNO R3
- Pololu MC33926
- 2x LEDs 
- 2x Pulse sensor (www.pulsesensor.com)
- 2x Carrera track analog controller (Therefore the Carrera PCB needs to be modified)
- 2x IR Light barriers (IR LED + IR Phototransistor)

The circuit can be found in the repository as well.
